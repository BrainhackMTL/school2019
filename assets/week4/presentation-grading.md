# Project presentation evaluation

You will have to present your project to the class during week 4. This
presentation will be graded and will count for 28% of your final grade.

Grading criteria will be evaluated using a 3-level scale:

* 1: does not meet expectations
* 2: partially meets expectations
* 3: totally meets expectations

Grades will be given by several instructors and averaged to obtain the
final presentation grade.

## Use of best practices (1-3)

## Skills and technologies learnt (1-3)

during the school, through formal presentations or informal interactions.

## Project relevance (1-3)
